# Bank-Churn-Rate
This project is an analysis into the abnormal churn rates of a European bank that have been experiencing a high churn rate. This project will involve several variables ranging from Age to Credit Score. We will use Tableau to create meaningful visuals and pull insights as to why the bank may be having high churn rates. Also, we will create a predictive model that can help us pin point those customers who are at risk of leaving the bank. We will use a mock-up data sample consisting of 10,000 randomly-selected customers of the bank.  But first, we will do data preparation and a little ETL.

#Data Preparation

##Comma Delimiter and Text Qualifier
We will first run the .txt file through Excel to apply a comma delimiter and text qualifier.
